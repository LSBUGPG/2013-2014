On this Disk you will find:

The weekly exercises categorised into folders by week.
The Robot AI in the week 12 folder (as it was done as the week 12 exercise).
An Excel spreadsheet containing all time logs put into a single table (time for the logs is shown in seconds).
Within certain folders there will be a .txt file noting the time it took for parts of the exercise in the same folder.
