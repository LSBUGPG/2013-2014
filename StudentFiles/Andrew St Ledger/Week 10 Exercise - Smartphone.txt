Subject - Smartphone

A smartphone is a small device that is used primarily as a method of communication with others of our species, and we are usually able to reach any part of the planet provided that the
other also has this device. Although not widely used, we are also able to speak to groups of others.

Another, arguably more remarkable use of a smartphone is that they are able to tap in to our planet-wide information network, the Internet, where almost all of the collective knowledge of
humanity can be found. Someone could find a short history of their region of the planet almost instantaneously.

In addition, they are able to host something called a "video game", a short, amusing activity used as a form of entertainment by humans.
