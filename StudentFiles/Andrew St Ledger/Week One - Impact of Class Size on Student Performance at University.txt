The impact of class size on the performance of university students:

This study notes that in the years 1995-2005, there was an average annual increase of more than 4% in university enrolment in OECD countries.
Although literature already published on effects of larger classes in primary and secondary schools provided assistance, the impact of such growth in universities was not well understood.

After conducting research and estimating the outcome of a class increase of the average 56 to 89 pupils, a conclusion, somewhat expected, was reached.

What do you think the outcome was?

Negative effect (AVERAGE 9% DROP IN MARKS FOR GIVEN STUDENT) - YES/NO
Positive effect (AVERAGE 6% RISE IN MARKS FOR GIVEN STUDENT) - YES/NO
