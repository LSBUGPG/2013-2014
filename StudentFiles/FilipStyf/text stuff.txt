According to Swiss financial services company UBS, being able to tell the difference between safe and risky investment opportunities has become more important in today’s economic environment; and they predict that, for the foreseeable future, the market’s attitude to investment will largely depend on what political decisions and policies will be put in place to soften the influence of the low growth.

For investors concerned with portfolio construction, this means that a combination of safe and risky investments is the key to competitive advantage in the current ‘low growth - low return’ capital constrained environment. The UBS long-term objective is to invest in high quality businesses, which is supported by their combination of safe investments in so called “dividend aristocrats”; i.e. high income, conservatively funded, self sustaining businesses who are experiencing secular growth.
