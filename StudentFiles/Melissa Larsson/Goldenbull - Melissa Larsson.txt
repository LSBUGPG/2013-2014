The NHS Cheshire Warrington and Wirral Commissioning support organisation is unique for its systematised methodology for project and programme management of varying sizes in service re-design and implementation. The options that are taken through a process to arrive at the content for an output based specification are built in equality and risk impact assessments. This is foreseen as a result of the implementation.
