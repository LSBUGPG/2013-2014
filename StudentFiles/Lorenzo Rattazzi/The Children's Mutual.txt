The concern shown by OLM about lower base fees in 2010 is not supported by evidence.

The PCT will apply, via the NHS Operating Framework 2012/13, a negative value of all our supplier contracts in the sum of -1.8%. 

This is to reflect the pressures on the health care system as a result of the national economic situation and the price for the deliveries.

All care homes fees need to be adjusted, deducting -1.8% and then adding 1.25%. the 1.25% is an advanced payment for CQUINs. 

Another 1.25% can be achieved at the end of each quarter if CQUINs are met; this payment will be made by NHS Norfolk & Waveney.
