The NHS Cheshire Warrington and Wirral Commissioning support organisation re-designs and re-implements services with its unique methodology. The organisation chooses options, weighted by equality and risk impact, to create its plan.

The service includes support from Clinical Commissioning Groups. These groups direct an implementation team to see the service re-design through to evaluation and benefits realisation.
