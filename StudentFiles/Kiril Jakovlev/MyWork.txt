A unique factor of the NHS Cheshire Warrington and Wirral Commissioning is the of support organisation and its systematised methodology for projects and programme management of small, medium and large services of re-design and implementation.
Building in equality and risk impact assessments the options are taken through a process to arrive at the content of an output based on specification and benefits foreseen as a result of the implementation.

The service is inclusive of full engagement with Clinical Commissioning Groups who direct the decision-making points and how they wish the proposal to be deployed for example (re-commmisson, de-commission or changes to current services/providers), and lastly an implementation of a team who see the service of redesign through the evaluation benefits the realisation.
