I am writing to inform you that on the 15th October 2012, the London Borough of Enfield made a direction under a article of the Town and Country Planning Order of 1995.

The concern relates to development consisting of a change of the use of a building. To a use falling within Class C4 of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning Order 1987 from a use falling within Class C3 of that Schedule. This removes permitted development rights for this type of development from the date when the direction comes into force.
