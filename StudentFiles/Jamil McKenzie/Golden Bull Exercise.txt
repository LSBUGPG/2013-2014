Where PSS benefits are indexed by specific reference to the Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) these will continue to be so indexed. This means that if and when the financial state of the Scheme allows for non-statutory increases to pensions in payment (including to pre-1997 accrued pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension) under the terms of Clause 19 or 17 of the Trust Deed these will still be referenced to March/March RPI (subject to a cap).
