#summary week two CW2 example

= Task =

Create a simple UnityScript program to interpolate something in your Unity Scene.

= Code =

{{{
#pragma strict

var from: Transform;
var to: Transform;

var amount: float = 0;

function Update() {
	
	amount += Time.deltaTime;
	transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(from.position, to.position, Mathf.Repeat(amount, 1));
}
}}}

= Notes =

The two transforms: `from` and `to` represent the start and end of the interpolation. The variable `amount` represents the current progress through the interpolation. The function `Mathf.Repeat` takes a value and modulates it to the given range; in this example the range is 0 to 1.

= Submission =

Submitted as a .js file to source control.
