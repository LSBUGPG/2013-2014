#summary example CW2 week 5

== Task ==

The task is to take a common game programming problem, research the formula required to solve the problem, and convert that solution into UnityScript code.

== Problem statement ==

To calculate the angle of elevation required to hit a target at a known distance with a projectile fired at a fixed velocity. The projectile will fall under gravity.

== Formula ==

The formula for calculating the angle of elevation required to hit a given range and projectile velocity is:

where the theta symbol is the angle, g is gravity, R is the range, and v is the velocity.

== Solution ==

Here is the UnityScript to find the angle of elevation in degrees or return -1 if the target is out of range.

{{{
function ElevationAngle (target: Transform, velocity: float): float {

    var range: float = target.position.x - transform.position.x;
    var gravity: float = Physics2D.gravity.magnitude;
    var sine: float = (gravity * range) / (velocity * velocity);
    var angle: float = -1.0;
    if (sine >= -1 && sine <= 1) {
        angle = 0.5 * Mathf.Asin(sine);
    }

    return angle * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
}
}}}

== Notes ==

This function assumes that you and your target are aligned with the world axes in 2D and that you are at the same height (y value).
